            <p>This book is originally written in German, and while I would have preferred to read it in the original language, I think the translation was still beautiful. This book is a family drama, and also deals with love, loss, and grief. The protagonist is vulnerable and very human, and I appreciated that a lot. I really enjoyed Wells' beautiful and quiet prose. It's a serious book, but very much worth the read, and I really loved it.</p>

            <p>This is supposed to be one of the longest books in the English language, standing at 1474 pages.Though it is a long book, I really enjoyed it and it didn't seem like such a long because I was so engaged throughout reading it. The book is about Lata Mehra, a young college-going woman whose elder siblings have been married off, and now it's her turn. Her mother is focused on finding her a "suitable boy." The book takes place in a fictional city of Brahmpur in the early 1950s, just after India gained independence from Britain in 1947. The book chronicles Lata's mother's search for a groom for her, Lata and her potential love interests, as well as the political decisions being made in a newly independent India. This book may not be for everyone, given the length and number of characters. It is also a slower-paced story, so if you prefer a quickly-paced plot, you may not like this book. However, I really enjoyed getting lost in the book. Seth's world-building is intricate, and he includes so many details that make the book so vivid. I would definitely recommend reading this book!</p>

            <p>The Midnight Library is about a young woman named Nora Seed who isn't happy with her current life. She tries to commit suicide, but instead finds herself in a library of infinite books, where every book represents a life she could have led had she made a slightly different decision. One book represents her current life. She can enter any book she picks off the shelf, but if she chooses to leave the book and come back to the library, that book/different life disappears. Nora has to decide which of the lives she wants to live. I really enjoyed this book and unique concept. We always wonder what our lives would have been like had we done something differently, or we sometimes feel fed up with our current lives, like we're stuck in a rut. This book had a beautiful message about life and the importance of living, which made me tear up a bit!</p>

            <p>Fredrik Backman has a unique writing style, which is light, witty, and chuckle-inducing, yet also heart-breaking and hard-hitting at the same time. This book is about an apartment viewing that gets interrupted by a bank robber who holds the people at the viewing hostage. As the police try to negotatiate the hostage situation, the hostages bond amongst themselves, revealing their quirks. The robber has to decide whether to stay in the apartment or reveal themselves to the police. This book isn't a mystery, except for who the bank robber is, and why they're in this situation. It's a poignant book, and a good insight into humanity. I really loved this book.</p>

            <p>This book was hard to read because of how horrifying the incidents are. Set in the 1980s during Sri Lanka's Civil War, Sashi is a sixteen-year-old girl who wants to become a doctor. However, a civil war rips the country, as the Tamil minority, including her family, are put into jeopardy. As the violence continues, she starts to question what she will do, and so decides to join the fight for Tamil independence. This book was well-written, with beautiful prose and heartbreaking lines. I thought it showed a very human view of the war, as a character stuck in the middle of the conflict, and it was a very empathetic and complex view of the situation. What made it haunting for me was that while the protagonist was fictional, the conflict and atrocities weren't. I think this was a heart-breaking but well-written story.</p>

            <p>I read Aanchal Malhotra's first book, "Remnants of a Separation," which was a nonfiction book that narrates the events of India's Partition through the objects that people took with them as they fled across the border. That book was very well-written and researched, and tragic as well, given how violent and traumatic Partition was. This is her first novel, and I think it was a wonderful fiction debut. The book is set in Lahore, and follows the story of Samir Vij, a young Hindu man whose passion is making perfume. He falls in love with Firdaus Khan, a young Muslim woman who is a calligrapher. When an undivided India is suddenly fractured in two, and when people of different religions turn on each other, Samir is forced to flee Lahore to India, and thus is separated from Firdaus. I really loved Malhotra's lush prose and attention to detail. I liked the attention to the intricacies of perfume, and how that plays a big role in the story. The story was very moving and heart-breaking, as it shows how ordinary people were affected by politics and the aftermath of the British Raj. The love story is beautiful, and exactly that "old school" love that is always so charming. I would highly recommend reading this book.</p>
