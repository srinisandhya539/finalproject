            <p>This has to be one of my favorite movies. It's about the relationship between Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane Hawking, and how they deal with his ALS diagnosis. I am a huge Eddie Redmayne fan, and I think he did a really good job acting as Stephen Hawking. It is a sad movie, but really well made. I also love the soundtrack by Johann Johansson, as it is emotional and beautiful.</p>

            <p>This isn't a very well-known movie, and it didn't get a lot of press. I happened to discover it and watched it, and it was a very endearing and charming movie. The movie is based on a true story about a woman who parks her van on a man's driveway, and proceeds to stay there for the next 15 years. I loved Maggie Smith in this movie, as she makes her character quirky and endearing. I loved the comedy as well. It's funny without being over the top. This is a more offbeat/indie film, but definitely worth the watch, in my opinion. </p>

            <p>This is one of my favorite Tamil movies, and I fell in love with it the first time I watched it. It's about a photography teacher called Ram who comes back to his old school for a school reunion of the '96 batch. He meets Jaanu, his childhood sweetheart, and they start talking and reminiscing about the old days. The film cuts back and forth between the past and the present, and perfectly captures the nostalgia of school. This was a very quiet movie, and not too dramatic, which I appreciated. The songs are also beautiful and fit the movie so well. </p>

            <p>This is such an enjoyable film and a well-made slice-of-life film. I am a huge fan of the lead actress, and I think that this is one of her best films so far. This Hindi movie is about an independent woman named Piku who has a complicated love-hate relationship with her elderly father. Her father wants to visit his home city, so he and Piku go on a road trip with a friendly cab driver who gets caught in their dysfunctional relationship. This movie made me laugh and also made me emotional too, and I think it portrays a father-daughter bond really well.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This is one of the most intricate and mind-blowing shows I've ever watched. I wasn't prepared for how complex and surprising this show was going to be. Every episode I learnt more information, but I felt like I knew less. This show has so many nuances and things to keep track of, but I enjoyed every bit of it. The show takes place in a small German town called Winden, when a boy suddenly goes missing, and the whole town searches for him, revealing dark secrets about the town in the process. Like the name suggests, the show is dark, but so well-made. I thought it was going to be an ordinary mystery, but it turned out to be so much more than that. I would definitely recommend this show!</p>

            <h3>The Brokenwood Mysteries</h3>
              <div class="container">

                <div class="text">Acorn TV</div>
            </div>
            </div>
             <p>This has to be one of my favorite TV series ever! The show is set in a small town in New Zealand called Brokenwood, and it starts when DSS (Detective Senior Sergeant) Mike Shepherd moved from Auckland to Brokenwood, and has to adjust to life there. Along with his team, Detective Kristin Sims and Detective Constable Breen, he solves murders in the quaint little town. This show is quite light actually, filled with subtle humor and quirky characters. It is such a delight to watch! </p>

            </div>
            </div>
            <p>I also really love this British mystery series, as it is made really well, and with nuance. It focuses on a special division of the London Metropolitan Police, headed by DCI Cassie Stuart and DI Sunny Khan, that solves cold cases. Each season covers one case, and all the potential suspects are actually introduced in the very first episode. What I really like about the show is that it portrays the suspects as human, with their own virtues and faults. Not all the suspects are completely rotten, and I thought it was a very realistic portrayal of people. It's a more slow-paced show, but it managed to keep me hooked. </p>

            </div>
            </div>
            <p>This was a very different type of show to what I've watched before, in a great way. It's a very sweet show, with light moments, as well as more emotional ones. The show is about a 70-year-old grandmother who wants to get away from her suffocating son, so she, her daughter-in-law, and granddaughter all sneak away on a road trip across India, each woman trying to escape things that tie them down. The character of the grandmother is such a riot!</p>
