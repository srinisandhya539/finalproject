            <h3>Kushagra, Showkidd</h3>
            <p>This song has been looping in my head all week. It's catchy, and I like the singer's tone, as well as the kind of lo-fi vibe to it. I'd never heard of this song or singer before, so I was super happy to discover it!</p>

        <h2>Fix You</h2>
        <h3>Coldplay</h3>
        <p>This song has been a favorite of mine for a very long time, and it's from their 2005 "X & Y" album. I've been a huge Coldplay fan since I was around 10 years old. Coldplay's songs are so beautiful and uplifting, and this song is no different. It's a song that makes me very emotional, and the lyrics hit hard!</p>

            <h3>Dido</h3>
            <p>I've been listening to Dido's music since my childhood. I think she's a very underrated singer, with a beautiful voice and meaningful lyrics. This song is from her 2013 album called "Girl Who Got Away," and it's my favorite from the album.</p>

            <h3>Isak Danielson</h3>
            <p>I absolutely love Isak Danielson's songs! His voice is so deep and strong, and his songs are filled with emotion. His lyrics are also thoughtful and meaningful, which is really nice. This song is one of the first of his songs that I listened to, and I loved the dark vocals and instrumentals. It gives me goosebumps in a good way!</p>

            <h2>Hayyoda</h2>
            <h3>Anirudh Ravichander, Priya Mali</h3>
            <p>I am quite obsessed with this song, ever since it released a few months ago. The singer and composer, Anirudh Ravichander, is one of my favorite Indian musicians. This song is so soothing, upbeat, and makes me want to dance! </p>
